## 4. Usage Patterns Between Different Campuses

### Term-by-Term Activity

| Campus  | Fall 2024 | Spring 2025 | Summer 2025 | Total |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| SKYLINE | 126       | 158         | 55          | 339   |
| CSM     | 92        | 93          | 10          | 195   |
| CANADA  | 70        | 105         | 11          | 186   |

### Key Patterns:

- **SKYLINE** shows the most consistent activity across all terms
- **Spring 2025** was the most active term overall (356 doorcards)
- **Summer 2025** shows significantly lower activity across all campuses
  (typical for summer terms)
- **SKYLINE** has the highest engagement with 1.7 doorcards per user
- **Cross-campus activity**: 20 users have doorcards at multiple campuses

## 5. Users with No Campus Assigned

### User Profile Campus Assignment:

- **Total users in system**: 2,130
- **Users with campus in profile**: 1 (0.0%)
- **Users without campus in profile**: 2,129 (99.95%)

### Important Notes:

- Campus assignment is managed at the **doorcard level**, not user profile level
- All 432 active users have campus assignments through their doorcards
- Only 1 user out of 2,130 has a campus assigned in their user profile
- This indicates the system relies on doorcard-level campus assignments rather
  than user profile settings

## Key Insights

1. **SKYLINE Dominance**: SKYLINE campus leads in both doorcards (47.1%) and
   users (47.2%)
2. **Balanced Distribution**: Despite SKYLINE's lead, all three campuses show
   healthy activity levels
3. **Cross-Campus Users**: 4.6% of users have doorcards at multiple campuses,
   indicating inter-campus collaboration
4. **Active User Base**: 20.3% of all system users have created doorcards in
   recent terms
5. **Seasonal Patterns**: Summer terms show reduced activity, which is typical
   for academic institutions

## Data Quality Notes

- **Usage Analytics**: Views, prints, and shares data are not yet populated in
  the database
- **Campus Assignment**: Analysis is based on doorcard campus assignments rather
  than user profile data
- **User Roles**: All active doorcard users (100%) have the "FACULTY" role
- **Data Integrity**: No missing campus assignments found in doorcards from
  recent terms

## Recommendations

1. Consider implementing user profile campus assignment for better user
   management
2. Monitor cross-campus users for potential collaboration opportunities
3. Investigate the low summer activity to determine if additional engagement is
   needed
4. Implement usage analytics tracking to get deeper insights into actual
   doorcard engagement
