# Doorcard Data Quality Report

**Generated**: 8/7/2025, 7:21:30 PM

## Executive Summary

The analysis of the doorcard system has identified significant data quality
issues stemming from the legacy Access database import. These issues are
affecting the user experience and need immediate attention.

### Key Findings

- **26** of 183 faculty doorcards (14.2%) have data quality issues
- **1118** duplicate appointments found
- **1176** overlapping appointment conflicts detected
- **105.4%** of all appointments have issues

## Impact on Users

1. **Student Confusion**: Students viewing faculty schedules see conflicting
   time slots
2. **Faculty Frustration**: Faculty cannot accurately represent their
   availability
3. **System Credibility**: Data quality issues undermine trust in the new system

## Root Causes

1. **Legacy Data Import Issues**
   - Access database used placeholder dates (12/30/99)
   - No validation during import process
   - Truncated location fields

2. **Data Entry Problems**
   - Manual entry allowed duplicate appointments
   - No overlap validation in legacy system
   - Department/course mismatches

2. **Notify affected faculty** about data corrections
3. **Update import process** to prevent future issues

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Implement validation rules** for appointment creation
2. **Add overlap detection** in the UI
3. **Create data quality dashboard** for ongoing monitoring

### Long-term (Next Month)

1. **Integrate with WebSchedule API** for real-time data
2. **Implement comprehensive data validation**
3. **Establish data governance procedures**

## Technical Details

### Corrections Pending

- Would delete 1118 duplicate appointments
- Would adjust 58 overlapping appointments
- Would affect 26 faculty doorcards

**Note**: Run the cleanup script with --fix flag to apply corrections

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Overlapping appointments causing student confusion
- **Medium Risk**: Missing location data affecting findability
- **Low Risk**: Legacy date formats (internal only)

## Success Metrics

Post-cleanup targets:

- 0% duplicate appointments
- <1% overlapping appointments (legitimate cross-listings only)
- 100% appointments with location data
- 100% department/course alignment
